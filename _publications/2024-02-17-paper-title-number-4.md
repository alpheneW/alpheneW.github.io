Abstract: 'This paper investigates the effect of software registration on China’s manufacturing ex-
ports from 2000 to 2013 against the backdrop of rapid growth in the digital economy
and international trade. Our results indicate a positive association between software
registration, a unique proxy for digital economy development, and manufacturing
firm exports. This finding remains robust across various tests, including Bartik IV es-
timation, different estimators, and subsample analyses. Mechanism analysis suggests
that software registration may bolster exports by reducing firms’ production and op-
erational costs while mitigating information frictions in international markets, thereby
incentivizing firms to expand their export activities to diverse markets. Furthermore,
extended analyses reveal heterogeneous impacts across firm ownership, regions, in-
dustries, and destinations. Overall, our findings underscore the significant linkage
between software registration and firm exports, providing a novel perspective on the
digital economy’s influence on international trade.'
